#### About Me 🌐

Enthusiastic Data Science Bootcamp graduate passionate about leveraging data to innovate in the travel tech industry. Currently transitioning from a dynamic customer care role in travel wholesale, eager to apply analytical skills to real-world challenges.


#### Professional Highlights 🌟
- 🔭 I'm currently managing international group tour operations at a wholesale travel company, refining problem-solving and coordination skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently actively working on building my data science portfolio, focusing on projects in data analysis, machine learning and visualization to drive insights and solve business problems. 


### Projects 📖
- [Airbnb listings of BCN in 2023](https://github.com/Mengyuan-animo/Airbnb_Barcelona_2023_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.git): Analyzed Barcelona’s 2023 Airbnb listings using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, folium) to explore neighbourhood supply/demand, room-type popularity, and pricing drivers. Identified how features such as location, license status, and availability influence price and visualized spatial patterns with interactive maps.
- [Travel & Tourism Development Index (TTDI) Power BI Dashboard](https://github.com/Mengyuan-animo/Travel_Tourism_Development_Analysis_PowerBI.git): This project transforms raw, multi-level TTDI data into an interactive Power BI dashboard using advanced Power Query data modeling (unpivoting wide tables, building star-schema fact and dimension tables) and DAX measures for dynamic averages, rankings, rank changes, and time-based comparisons. The report consists of three analytical layers—Global Overview, Dimension & Pillar Drivers, and Trend & Potential Analysis—combining maps, matrices, scatter plots, and trend lines to analyze cross-country performance, structural drivers, and growth potential across years (2019–2024). The dashboard emphasizes decision-oriented insights through slicer-driven interactivity, hierarchical drill-downs, and comparative benchmarking at index, dimension, and pillar levels.
- [Retail Sales SQL Analysis](https://github.com/Mengyuan-animo/sql_retail_sales.git): Analyzed retail sales data using PostgreSQL to demonstrate SQL-based data exploration, cleaning, and analysis. Built and populated a sales database, performed data quality checks, conducted exploratory analysis, and discovered business questions such as monthly sales trends and best-selling periods using aggregations, CTEs and window functions.
