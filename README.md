#### About Me 🌐

Enthusiastic Data Science Bootcamp graduate passionate about leveraging data to innovate in the travel tech industry. Currently transitioning from a dynamic customer care role in travel wholesale, eager to apply analytical skills to real-world challenges.


#### Professional Highlights 🌟
- 🔭 I'm currently managing international group tour operations at a wholesale travel company, refining problem-solving and coordination skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently actively working on building my data science portfolio, focusing on projects in data analysis, machine learning and visualization to drive insights and solve business problems. 


### Projects 📖
- [Airbnb listings of BCN in 2023](https://github.com/Mengyuan-animo/Airbnb_Barcelona_2023_Exploratory_Data_Analysis.git): Analyzed Barcelona’s 2023 Airbnb listings using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, folium) to explore neighbourhood supply/demand, room-type popularity, and pricing drivers. Identified how features such as location, license status, and availability influence price and visualized spatial patterns with interactive maps.
- [Barcelona housing market](https://github.com/Mengyuan-animo/EDA_Barcelona-Houses-Selling-Prices.git): Analyzed Barcelona’s real estate datasets, including second-hand sales listings (Idealista, 2020), district-level selling prices (2013–2023), and rental prices (2014–2022), using Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn) to uncover long-term market trends. Examined price evolution across districts to identify areas with the highest appreciation, affordability shifts, and changing demand patterns. Calculated rental yields and price-to-rent ratios to evaluate which districts offer the strongest investment potential from a return-on-rental perspective. Created visualizations to compare districts over time, generating insights applicable to property investment decisions and urban housing strategy.
- [Retail Sales SQL Analysis](https://github.com/Mengyuan-animo/sql_retail_sales.git): Analyzed retail sales data using PostgreSQL to demonstrate SQL-based data exploration, cleaning, and analysis. Built and populated a sales database, performed data quality checks, conducted exploratory analysis, and discovered business questions such as monthly sales trends and best-selling periods using aggregations, CTEs, and window functions.
